This is a gift sub grabbing bot for Dlive.

I hacked stuff together and got it running. I get about 3FPS

in the windowcapture.py the window sizing is kinda meh.
If you change the browser size you're going to need to re set things.

Do not expect said current settings to work
1900 px x 1100 px is the size of the browser i use.

some stuff like the dropping the alpha cahnnel isn't really needed.  

it would be nice to when a gifted sub pops up to save that img as something new.
and to draw a box around the clicked area.

It would be nice to add some safe guard against "user input"
use at your own risk since currently trusting the user input 

would be nice to raise a flag or pop up notifcation if you get a sub.

in versions said stuff above is the direction.

will print how many times it cylced and subs grabbed at end
